# Security Policy

We prioritize security throughout planning, development, and operations.

## Principles
- Least privilege and secure defaults
- Encrypt data in transit and at rest
- Strong authentication and authorization (RBAC)
- Defense-in-depth with layered controls
- Secure SDLC with reviews, scanning, and validation gates

## Practices
- Secrets never committed; use environment variables and secret stores
- Regular dependency updates and vulnerability scans
- Security headers and HTTPS everywhere
- Input validation and centralized error handling
- Logging, monitoring, and alerting for critical actions

## Responsible Disclosure
Please report vulnerabilities responsibly to the maintainers. Provide steps to reproduce and potential impact. We aim to acknowledge within 3 business days.
